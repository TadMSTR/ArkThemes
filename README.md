# ArkThemes

Theme installer for [ArkOS](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos)  
Tested on the RG351P and RGB10  

Adapted [AnberPorts](https://github.com/krishenriksen/AnberPorts) by [kreal](https://github.com/krishenriksen) to make a theme installer and updater. Currently only themes by [Jetup](https://github.com/Jetup13) are included.  
Thanks to **choo t** for the theme update script used to install/update the supported themes

## Updates  
Added an uninstaller. Be mindful that you can remove stock themes with this. Currently no way to reinstall them via ArkThemes.

## Installation  
Need to be on ArkOS 2021-02-13 (02132021) or newer.  
Place *ArkThemes.sh* and *ArkThemes* folder in `/roms/tools`
You can do this over your network, or by plugging the sdcard into your PC. In that case the location would be `EASYROMS/tools`.

Now in ArkOS Options menu there will be a folder called **Tools** and ArkThemes can be run from there.
